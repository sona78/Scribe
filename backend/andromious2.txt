Unsurprisingly, the NFL has fined Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf for what transpired late in the 4th quarter of the team’s 30-13 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

Metcalf was seen shoving cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon to the ground well away from the play, causing rib and hip contusions. As if that wasn’t enough, Metcalf was jawing at the Rams sideline out of the injury timeout and was flagged for taunting, turning 2nd and 2 into 2nd and 17 and the end of any chance of a Seahawks comeback.

I suppose the only good news for Metcalf is his behavior didn’t merit a suspension in the eyes of the league, but he will be forking over just under $22,000 for his infractions.
